# A practical, real-world Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and CQRS Example: Basket API 🛒

> **A practical, real-world clean architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD) application with more than 20 design patterns for managing shopping basket operations.**

The **Basket Bounded Context** application is a real-world example of **Domain-driven Design (DDD)**, implementing patterns like **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)** and adhering to **Clean Architecture** principles. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of shopping baskets, including:

- Creating baskets
- Adding items
- Updating item quantities
- Removing items
- Managing Coupons
- Applying discounts and coupons

Built with **C#**, this application demonstrates how to structure software with **DDD**, **CQRS**, and **Clean Architecture**, ensuring maintainability, scalability, and adherence to domain-driven practices.

## 🏗 Clean Architecture Overview
![BasketContext Diagram](images/SystemBoundriesBasketApi.png)

**BasketContext** is structured around the **Clean Architecture** principles:

1. **Domain Layer**:
   - Contains the core business logic.
   - Aggregate Roots: `Basket`, `Coupon`.
   - Entities: `BasketItem`, `Customer`, `Seller`.
   - Value Objects: `Quantity`,`Amount`.
   - Domain Events: `BasketItemAddedEvent`, `BasketItemRemovedEvent` etc.
   - Domain Services: `ISellerLimitService`, `ICouponService`.
   - Factories : the factories for the most of domain aggregate and entities with Test factories

2. **Application Layer**:
   - Use cases for basket operations (e.g., `AddItemToBasketCommand`).
   - Interfaces for services like `ICouponService`.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Handles persistence with **Entity Framework Core**.
   - Mapping between domain models and database entities.

4. **API Layer**:
   - Exposes HTTP endpoints for basket operations.
   - Built with **ASP.NET Core**.

## Interaction Flow in DDD and Clean Architecture

The interaction flow between components in our system is designed with DDD principles and Clean Architecture. Below is a detailed flow diagram:

    participant DomainModel

    participant DomainEventHandler
    participant IntegrationEventHandler

    User->>WebAPI: Sends Request
    WebAPI->>ApplicationLayer: Forwards Request (CQRS)
    ApplicationLayer->>DomainModel: Acts on Domain Aggregates and Entities
    DomainModel-->>EventDispatcher: Raises Domain Events
    EventDispatcher->>DomainEventHandler: Publishes Events
    DomainEventHandler-->>IntegrationEventHandler: Maps to Integration Events (if needed)
```

## ⚙️ Domain-Driven Design Principles and Patterns

1. **Entities**:
   - Rich domain models encapsulating business rules.
   - Example: `Basket` ensures valid operations like adding items and calculating totals.

2. **Value Objects**:
   - Immutable objects representing concepts like `Quantity`.

3. **Aggregates**:
   - Aggregate root: `Basket` and `Coupon` Aggregate roots manage consistency across related entities.

4. **Domain Events**:
   - Notify systems of domain changes (e.g., `BasketItemDeactivatedEvent`,`BasketItemCoundUpdatedEvent`).

5. **Integration Events**:
   - Notify external systems of domain changes (e.g., `BasketItemAddedEvent`).

6. **Domain Services**:
   - Encapsulate complex business logic that doesn't naturally fit within an entity or value object.
   - Example: `ICouponService` validates and applies coupons to a basket.

7. **Modules**:
   - Group related aggregates, entities, and services into cohesive units.
   - Example: The `BasketModule` encapsulates all operations related to managing a shopping basket.

8. **Application Services**:
   - Coordinate application workflows by interacting with domain and infrastructure layers.
   - Example: `AddItemToBasketCommandHandler` orchestrates the addition of items to a basket.

9. **Factories**:
   - Provide centralized logic for creating complex domain objects while ensuring invariants are upheld.
   - Example: `BasketFactory` simplifies the creation of a `Basket` with default settings and dependencies.

10. **Repositories**:
    - Interfaces for interacting with aggregates.
    - Example: `IBasketRepository` abstracts the persistence of `Basket` entities.
11. **Ubiquitous Language**:
    - Shared terminology between developers, domain experts, and stakeholders.
    - Example: Terms like `Basket`, `BasketItem`, `Coupon`, and `Seller` are part of the shared vocabulary.

12. **Bounded Context**:
    - Defines the boundary within which the domain model is valid and consistent.
    - Example: The `BasketContext` focuses solely on shopping basket operations and is separate from contexts like `Inventory` or `Payment`.

## Design Patterns Used

This repository showcases the use of several well-known design patterns, providing real-world examples of how they can be applied in a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** context:

### 1. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - **Description**: Separates the read and write responsibilities to improve scalability and maintainability.
   - **Usage**: Command handlers are used for state-changing operations, while query handlers handle data retrieval.

### 2. **Result Pattern**
   - **Description**: Encapsulates success or failure outcomes, ensuring error handling is explicit and consistent.
   - **Usage**: Used in handler methods to return meaningful results with error messages.

### 3. **Decorator Pattern**
   - **Description**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects without altering their structure.
   - **Usage**: Enhances validation and business rules in the domain layer.

### 4. **Mediator Pattern**
   - **Description**: Simplifies communication between components by centralizing interactions.
   - **Usage**: Implements **MediatR** for handling commands and queries in a decoupled manner.

### 5. **Publisher-Subscriber Pattern**
   - **Description**: Enables asynchronous communication between components through event publishing and handling.
   - **Usage**: Domain events trigger integration events that are published to Kafka.

### 6. **Strategy Pattern**
   - **Description**: Enables selecting algorithms or behaviors at runtime.
   - **Usage**: Implements different discount strategies, such as percentage or fixed discounts.

### 7. **Template Method Pattern**
   - **Description**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm, allowing subclasses to override specific steps.
   - **Usage**: `CommandHandlerBase`, `ValueObject` etc.

### 8. **Factory Method Pattern**
   - **Description**: Provides a way to instantiate objects while abstracting the creation logic.
   - **Usage**: Ensures domain objects like `Basket` and `BasketItem` are created with all invariants upheld. Test project uses multiple factories.

### 9. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**
   - **Description**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
   - **Usage**: Used for applying a series of validation or business rules sequentially.

### 10. **Unit of Work Pattern**
   - **Description**: Ensures multiple operations on a database are performed as a single transaction.
   - **Usage**: Manages database interactions in the infrastructure layer, ensuring consistency.

### 11. **And More**
   - The repository demonstrates other patterns and principles, showcasing best practices in software design and development.
